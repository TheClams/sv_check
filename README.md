# Overview
SV Checker is a tool dedicated to development in SystemVerilog.

The long term goals is to offer a full-featured language server:
 - compilation check
 - linting
 - reformatting
 - refactoring
 - code completion

The idea is also that some features should be accessible in command line (lie compilation/linting),
and being compatible with the systemVerilog plugin to extend its existing features.

## Current status
 - [ ] Parsing of basic RTL file
 - [ ] Parsing of basic verification file (UVM)
 - [ ] Basic linting: port connection, signal declaration, fields, ...
 - [ ] Advanced linting
 - [ ] Basic LSP implementation
 - [ ] Reformatting
 - [ ] Refactoring
